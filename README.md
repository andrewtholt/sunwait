# sunwait

This a my fork of sunwait.  At the moment I have just added a simple script.

Sunwait is a small C program for calculating sunrise and sunset, as well as civil, nautical, and astronomical twilights. It has features that make it useful for home automation tasks.

Sunwait has been originally created by [Dan Risacher](https://www.risacher.org/sunwait/).
It has been updated and ported to Windows by Ian Craig. This repository is a copy of Ian Craig's [sunwait4windows](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sunwait4windows/).
